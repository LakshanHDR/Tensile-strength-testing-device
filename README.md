Universal testing machines are tools that provide mathematical models that allow the study of
the strength of materials, giving fundamental information for the mechanical characterization
of materials, by obtaining physical and mechanical properties that are the basis for the sizing
of any system or mechanical element. The basis of these destructive mechanical studies are
tensile tests, which are the primary tool for studying the behavior of the material. In the present
work, the design and construction of a low-cost, low-scale universal testing machine was
carried out, and tensile experimental tests on nano fiber mats were conducted. The tensile
testing machine consists of a stepper motor as an actuator, a load-cell, a load-cell amplifier, a
data acquisition system and the 3D printed machine frame. The detected load-cell signal is
amplified by the HX711 amplifier and is sent to the data acquisition (DAQ) system. The DAQ
system with Python based Tkinter GUI software receives the signals from the load-cell and
displacement from motor rotations, then plots the real-time stress-strain curve. Using this
testing machine, it is possible to conduct tensile tests on miniature tensile specimens (thin
films) at speeds of 1.0-8.0 mm/min. The maximum load it supports is 50 N, with a stroke range
of 0 to 400 mm. Testing results in force and displacement with a deviation of Â±2.5% of the real
values can be measured. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the machine
developed in this work can be used to perform tensile tests on nano fiber mats with reliable
results. The approximate cost of the constructed UTM is 100 US dollars.
